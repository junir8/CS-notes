# NLP & Big Model Basics

## Typical NLP Tasks

* Basic tasks
  * Part of speech
  * Name entity recognition
  * Co-reference
  * Basic dependencies
  * Word segmentation

* Applications
  * Search engine and Ad
  * Knowledge graph
  * Machine reading
  * Personal assistant
  * Machine translation
  * Sentiment analysis and opinion mining
  * Computational social science

## Distributed Word Representation

* goal of word representation
  * compute similarity
  * infer word relation
* synonym and hypernym, e.g., WordNet
  * missing nuance
  * missing new meanings of words
  * subjective
  * data sparsity
  * human labor
* One-hot, discrete
  *  similarity=0
 * represent word by context
  * increase in size with vocabulary
  * require a lot of storage
  * less frequent words
* word embedding
  * word2vec

## Language Model

* predict the upcoming word
* Joint prob., conditional prob
* n-gram
*
